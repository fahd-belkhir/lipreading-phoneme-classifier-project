This script extracts audio from a structured dataset of .mp4 videos and flattens the structure by:

*Converting each video into a mono .wav file at 16 kHz using ffmpeg.

*Copying the corresponding .txt transcript file.

*Renaming both outputs with a unique identifier (<folder>_<filename>) to avoid naming conflicts.

*Saving everything in a single output directory.

Typical Use Case:
Prepares the dataset (like LRS2) for Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) or other phoneme alignment tools by generating clean, standardized audio + transcript pairs.

Key Output:

*.wav files in output_folder with consistent formatting.

*.txt transcript files renamed to match the audio files.
