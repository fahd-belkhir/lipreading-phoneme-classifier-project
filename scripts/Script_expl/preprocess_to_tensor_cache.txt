Preprocesses aligned frameâ€“phoneme data into cached .pt files (PyTorch tensors) to enable fast training without real-time decoding or loading from images and JSON.

How It Works:

-Loads aligned frame+phoneme pairs from:
-JSON files (frames + phonemes)
-Cropped frame folders
-Converts each pair into:

A frames_tensor of shape (T, C, H, W)

A phoneme_tensor of shape (L,)

input_len and target_len values

Saves each sample into a .pt file for quick access during training.

Output Format per file:

{
  'frames': Tensor of shape (T, 3, 112, 112),
  'phonemes': Tensor of phoneme indices (L,),
  'input_len': Tensor([T]),
  'target_len': Tensor([L])
}


Typical Use Case:
Run this once before training to avoid repeated preprocessing and speed up training. Especially useful for large datasets or deep models where disk I/O and transformation time would be bottlenecks.
