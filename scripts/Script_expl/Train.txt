Trains the lipreading model using preprocessed frameâ€“phoneme tensor pairs and CTC loss. Supports both GRU-based and ViT-based models via import toggle.

How It Works:

-Loads phoneme vocabulary.
-Loads .pt tensor dataset from disk.
-Initializes model, CTC loss, and optimizer.
-Resumes from checkpoint if available.
-Trains in epochs with batch-level logging.
-Saves checkpoints periodically and at each epoch end.

Key Features:

Supports resume from last saved state.
Gracefully handles faulty samples using SafeDataset.
Compatible with both GRU and ViT models:
To switch models, change the import:

from model import LipReadingModel  # For GRU
from model_vit import LipReadingViTModel as LipReadingModel  # For ViT


Typical Use Case:
Used after preprocessing to train the phoneme-level lipreading model on a cached dataset efficiently and reliably.
