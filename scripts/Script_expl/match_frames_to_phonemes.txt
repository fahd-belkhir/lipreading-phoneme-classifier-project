A lightweight test script to verify phoneme-to-frame alignment for a single video. It maps each frame image to the corresponding phoneme label based on timestamp.

How It Works:

-Loads phoneme alignments from a .phn file.
-Lists all .jpg frames for one video.
-Calculates timestamps for each frame.
-Matches each timestamp to a phoneme interval.
-Prints each frame's name alongside the matched phoneme.

Output Example:

frame_000.jpg → SIL  
frame_001.jpg → DH  
frame_002.jpg → AH  
...


Typical Use Case:
Used for debugging or visual inspection to ensure phoneme alignments are correctly matched to video frames before launching full dataset processing.

Note:
Although cv2 is imported, it’s not used in this version of the script and can be safely removed unless needed for image display.
