Converts .TextGrid alignment files into simplified .phn files, which list phonemes with their start and end times. This format is easier to work with during model training and evaluation.

How It Works:

For each .TextGrid file:
*Extracts the 'phones' tier.
*Writes phoneme label, start time, and end time into a .phn file.

The resulting .phn files are stored in the specified output directory.

Output Format (.phn):

SIL 0.0 0.12
DH 0.12 0.25
AH 0.25 0.45

Typical Use Case:
Used after running Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) to convert alignment results into a custom phoneme format required for training a lipreading model.
