Extracts frames from .mp4 videos at a fixed rate (e.g., 25 FPS), and saves them as .jpg images for downstream processing (e.g., lipreading model training).

How It Works:

Traverses a folder containing subfolders of videos.

For each video:
-Samples frames at the specified frame rate.
-Saves them into a uniquely named output subfolder.
-Skips videos that don't exist or are malformed.

Output:

A set of folders named like subdir_filename/, each containing:

frame_000.jpg  
frame_001.jpg  
...


All frames are sampled uniformly to match the desired frame rate (e.g., 25 fps).
