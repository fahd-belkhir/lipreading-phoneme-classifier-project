Extracts phoneme-level alignments from a .TextGrid file produced by alignment tools such as Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA). Saves the extracted phonemes and their time intervals to a human-readable .phn file.

How It Works:

-Loads the 'phones' tier from the .TextGrid file.
-Extracts all non-empty phoneme intervals (start time, end time, label).
-Saves them as:

**PHONEME START_TIME END_TIME**

Can either print results to console or save to file depending on usage.

Output:

A .phn file with aligned phonemes for one utterance.

Typical Use Case:
Used after phoneme alignment with MFA to convert .TextGrid annotations into a simpler .phn format for further processing (e.g., training a lipreading model).
